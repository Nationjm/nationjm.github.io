        Creation of Autonomous Robot and Competition
    </h3>
    <p class="project-descriptions">
        During the spring semester of 2022, myself and three teammates were tasked with the <br>
        ideation and creation of a completely autonomous robot. We had to complete everything from <br>
        ideation to creation and everything between. The competition consisted of three challenges.<br>
        The first was to remove two ghosts from the competition zone. Second was to collect two <br>
        scooby snacks and deliver them to scooby's mouth. The third and final task was to deliver <br>
        a 3D printed model of one of the members of Mystery Incorporated.

        Autonomous Swarm Marine Robots
    </h3>
    <p class="project-descriptions">
        Myself and my teammates in Georgia Tech's Robotech hackathon created a prototype <br>
        of a collective of drone robots and a mothership that remove algal blooms from a large <br>
        body of water. During the weekend long hackathon, we were able to complete a 3D model<br> 
        of one of the drone robots, and we were able to create a visual simumlation of the drones <br> 
        removing the algal blooms of the body of water that we modeled using Python. When we <br> 
        were first considering how to model the drones, we considered using A* to model <br>
        them but we ended up going with a model that was more similar to an RRT which is a random <br>

    <p class="project-descriptions">
        During the spring semester of 2021, a team of myself and three peers designed and modeled<br>
        an improvement on the modern bicycle. We ideated and modeled the bicycle in SOLIDWORKS<br>
        by creating a multitude of parts as individuals. Then we combined each part in a shared assembly.<br>
        The assignment was to create an innovative object or product that was created by combining

        Creation of Portfolio Website
    </h3>
    <p class="project-descriptions">
        I created the website that you are currently reading and viewing using html, css, and javascript.<br>
        It was created during the spring and summer of 2022. I taught myself how to create basic webpages <br> 
        with html first so that I could understand the basics of web design. Secondly, I taught myself how <br>
        to design and edit webpages so that I could create the layout of the portfolio website that I<br>
        wanted. Finally, I taught myself how to code in Javascript, so that I could take advantage of  any<br>
        links and dropdown menus that I wanted to.
